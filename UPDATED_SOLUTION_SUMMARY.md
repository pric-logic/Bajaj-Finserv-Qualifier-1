# 🎉 Updated Solution Summary - Bajaj Finserv Health Java Qualifier

## ✅ SUCCESS! Application Updated with Specific SQL Query

Your Spring Boot application has been **successfully updated** to solve the specific SQL problem from the "SQL Question 1 JAVA.pdf" file. All requirements have been met and verified.

## 📋 SQL Problem Solved

### Original Problem Statement:
Find the highest salary that was credited to an employee, but only for transactions that were not made on the 1st day of any month. Along with the salary, extract the employee data like name (combine first name and last name), age and department who received this salary.

### Database Schema:
- **DEPARTMENT**: DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME
- **EMPLOYEE**: EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DOB, GENDER, DEPARTMENT
- **PAYMENTS**: PAYMENT_ID, EMP_ID, AMOUNT, PAYMENT_TIME

### Solution SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    p.AMOUNT as SALARY, 
    CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) as NAME, 
    YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(e.DOB) - (DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%m%d') < DATE_FORMAT(e.DOB, '%m%d')) as AGE, 
    d.DEPARTMENT_NAME 
FROM PAYMENTS p 
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID 
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID 
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) != 1 
ORDER BY p.AMOUNT DESC 
LIMIT 1
```

### Query Explanation:
1. **JOINs**: Connects PAYMENTS, EMPLOYEE, and DEPARTMENT tables
2. **WHERE clause**: Filters out payments made on the 1st day of any month
3. **CONCAT**: Combines first and last name into a single column
4. **Age calculation**: Calculates age based on date of birth
5. **ORDER BY**: Sorts by amount in descending order
6. **LIMIT 1**: Returns only the highest salary record
